Project Scenario:
The Hail Mary Roofing Company, LLC has built a successful business on roof repairs and replacements resulting from storm damage, especially hail, which is often covered by homeownerâ€™s insurance. They wish to expand their business into new markets and want to choose a geographic location based on the need for new roofs following significant storm damage.

Data Sources:
The NOAA Storm Events Database (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncdc-storm-events-database2) is a comprehensive dataset maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It records severe weather events across the United States, including hail, tornadoes, floods, and other significant storms. This is an authoritative, external dataset that provides detailed event information, such as date, location (state and county), event magnitude (e.g., hail size), and reported damages. The data is timely and available for prior years, making it a valuable resource for analyzing historical weather patterns and assessing the frequency and impact of severe storms in our current climate.

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides detailed demographic, social, economic, and housing data every year. The housing data from the ACS includes statistics on housing occupancy, types of housing units, home values, mortgage status, rent, and housing costs. Additional information about the dataset can be found here: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html
